# TicTacToe Game
## Inspiration:
This game has been created as a part of my self-learning on how to incorporate multiple assemblies and WCF in .NET framework.
TicTacToe is designed for multiplayers to play game. Refer to [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe) for game rules.
## What it does
- Set up user's profile with recommended daily water consumption
- Track water amount user drink during the day with visual chart
- Track history record of previous consumption periods (charts)
- Allow users to set up notification/ interval to remind them to drink water
## How I built it
The application incorporates different assemblies (service host assembly, class library assembly, Windows GUI).
Three types of contract have been implemented (service contract, data contract and callback contract
